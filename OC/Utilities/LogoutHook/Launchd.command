# Includes logic to install and run this script as one or more of
# agent, daemon or logout hook. Can also be run directly for testing,
# use CTRL+C for script termination.
#
# Currently installs just as launch daemon, which is the only one that
# on shutdown can access NVRAM after macOS installer vars are set.

# Examine log at /var/log/org.acidanthera.nvramhook.launchd/launchd.log.

# Non-installed script can be run directly as 'agent' or 'daemon', i.e. script
# is started and runs as if launched that way by launchd, for debugging purposes.
#
# Agent is currently a null install, mainly since it seemed a shame to remove
# that code - i.e. it installs, and stops and starts correctly, but unlike
# daemon it does not actually do anything at stop and start. (Daemon is sudo
# so not everything that daemon does can be done by agent, also not everything
# that daemon does needs to be done, by agent.)
#
# Note that agent shutdown is to early to pick up NVRAM changes made by macOS
# installer before first restart, whereas daemon is not.
